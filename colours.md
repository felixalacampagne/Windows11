#### Can't change the task bar to a sensible colour

This is probably because you took the sensible route and chose the 'Light' theme since no 
one in the right mind would want all the windows in that terrible off-black colour which makes
any text impossible to read.

Obviously if you choose the 'Light' mode you could not possibly want to change the taskbar from the
eyeball searing bright white colour. WTF? Of course I want to change the taskbar colour to something different! 

You guessed it, the continuous improvers have even taken the time to visit the colours menu. 
To change the taskbar it is now necessary to do the following;

- find Personalization->Colors
- set the 'mode' to 'Custom', the Windows mode to 'Dark' and the default app mode to 'Light'
- set the Accent colour to something which contrasts with the background as this determines the window border color
- it should now be possible to enable the 'Show accent colour on Start and taskbar' and 'Show accent color on title bars and windows borders' options

There now, wasn't that just so simple and obvious.... Not!
