Uninstalled Bnjour as it had a very old date andI figured it must be obsolete now.
Subsequently iTunes was unable to find any AirPlay devices so concluded that
Bonjour is still required. Reinstalled latest iTunes and Bonjour was back, with the same
old date. iTunes could once again see the AirPlay devices.

A few hours later I noticed a message from 'Program Compatibility Assistant' saying
a Bonjour DLL was blocked from loading into 'Local Security Authority'. I checked the
'Do not tell me ever again' option. Googling indicates that this is a long known
problem and that there is no solution as Apple must update Bonjour and refuses to do so.

Having closed the notification I confirmed that iTunes was still showing the 
available AirPlay devices AND that iTunes could send audio to an AirPlay device. 
Bonjour service was still running according to Task Manager. 

It did find a suggestion (https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255869043?sortBy=rank) 
that an 'exception' could be made for the problematic DLL. I haven't tried this yet
since the major reason for having iTunes, ie. AirPlay, is still working OK.

-) From Registry Editor locate registry key
   Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa
-) Find Security Packages and double-click it.
-) In the list that appears, add a new entry: mdnsnsp.dll
-) Click OK, close Regedit, and restart your PC.

Note that this suggestion is from an Apple site so is obviously complete bullshit.
There is no 'Security Packages' under the 'Lsa' key. 
Maybe creating a key 'Security Packages' and adding a string value with the DLL name
would work - I guess it's something to try if AirPlay stops working, eg. after rebooting.
