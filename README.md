# Windows11 aka If I wanted a Mac I would buy a Mac

Guess what?!! M$ has employed a bunch of continuous improvers and they have come up with Windows 11.

Because no one actually wants Windows 11 they are forcing happy WIndows 10 users to upgrade with dire
threats of impending doom, or worse, when 'support' for it ends sometime soon. Given that it is a free 
upgrade, as was the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (really, we don't talk about Windows 8), that would
be fine and dandy EXCEPT they are telling me that my only way to avert the impending armagedon 
is to BUY A NEW COMPUTER! WTF! My computer(s) are working just fine, I don't need anything other than what
they provide, there is no reason for me to replace something which is working perfectly adequately just
because M$ say I must.

So, this is the project where I will chronicle my adventures into the underworld of Windows 11, where I will hopefully 
document how I managed to wrangle this spawn of the continuous improvers into something which works for me.

Some of my machines are 'compatible' with the whims of M$, ie. can be upgraded from Windows 10, and some do 
not meet the entirely random criteria laid down my M$. Luckily there are those out there who have figured out
how to workaround this M$ insanity so I will be making use their efforts where required.
