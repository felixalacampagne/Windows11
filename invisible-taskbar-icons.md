## Shortcut icons in taskbar are invisible

This only seems to happen on one of the Windows 11 PCs, an HP Laptop. 
It usually happens after resuming from sleep. 
The icons can be restored by clicking on them but this is
a nuisance as it starts the programmes which then have to be stopped. 
An alternative is to restart Explorer from taskmanager but this is also a tedious
thing to do as all open folders then need to be reopened.

Apparently this is not a new 'feature' although I have only seen it since the
update to Windows 11.

Here is what I have tried so far:

- Disable 'Animation effects': Settings -> Accessibility -> Visual effects -> 'Animation effects': OFF
